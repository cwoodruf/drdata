<h3>Distributed Real Time Data Acquisition Toolkit (DRDAT) User Guide</h3>

DRDAT is a tool kit that lets you use your smart phone to participate in a research 
study. Your phone uses our web server called the <b>Study Management 
Interface (SMI)</b> to get tasks for you to complete. When you complete a task
any data you have entered will be automatically uploaded to the SMI. 

<h4>Using the DRDAT app</h4>
To use DRDAT you will need a participant log in for a specific study. This information
is recorded in the SMI by the researcher who is managing the study. Once you have your
login set up you can start by downloading tasks from the SMI. To do this select the
<b>View Tasks</b> choice in the DRDAT app, enter your email and password, and
press the "View Tasks" button. Tasks will be automatically downloaded to your phone. 
You will then see a list of your tasks plus any schedule information on when you should
do them. Don't worry if you forget, your phone's notification service will automatically 
remind you when you need to do a task. 
<p> 
To complete the task from a notification select the task from the notification list on
your phone and follow the instructions for the task. Once you are finished make sure to
press the <b>Save Data</b> button to save any data you have entered and upload it to our 
web server. If you feel you have made a mistake just redo the task and save it. 
Unfortunately, there is no facility for editing task data once you have uploaded it.
<p>
Remember, you can start a task at any time by selecting the "View Tasks" option of the
DRDAT app's main menu.

<h4>Changing settings</h4>
You can turn off notifications. However, if you restart the phone or the DRDAT app then
notifications are also automatically restarted.
<p>
If the url for the SMI server changes for some reason you can change the url by 
selecting "Settings". Do not change the url unless you know what you are doing.
However, if you have changed it you can always change the url back to the default.

<h4>Clearing data</h4>
If you want to remove your data from a mobile device running DRDAT select the
<b>Delete tasks and logins</b> and <b>Delete uploaded data</b> options. Note
that the latter option will only remove data that has already been uploaded to
the SMI web server. You can manually upload the data with the <b>Upload Data to Smi</b>
option.
<p>
Alternatively, delete and reinstall the DRDAT app to remove all stored information on
the device.
