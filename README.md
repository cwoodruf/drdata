This is an android app and website for managing self reporting studies.
It was created as a class project for CMPT276 at SFU.

Study participants use mobile devices to enter data on a schedule managed
by the mobile device. Schedules and questionnaires are managed via the 
website.

The original version can be found in the "drdat" repository. That project is
not in use. However, this project is deployed and in use.

The "ra" repository is an extension of this: it provides a way to 
easily generate online or on-mobile surveys via website using a survey
markup language.
